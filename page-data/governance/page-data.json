helpful</li>\n<li>significant contributions to the project's goals, in any form</li>\n<li>willingness to dedicate some time to improving Manim</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As the project matures, contributions go beyond code.\r\nHere's a non-exhaustive list of areas where contributions may be considered for joining the core team, in no particular order:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Working on community management and outreach</li>\n<li>Providing support on social media and the Discord server</li>\n<li>Triaging tickets</li>\n<li>Writing patches (code, docs, or tests)</li>\n<li>Reviewing patches (code, docs, or tests)</li>\n<li>Participating in design decisions</li>\n<li>Providing expertise in a particular domain (security, i18n, etc.)</li>\n<li>Managing the continuous integration infrastructure</li>\n<li>Managing the servers (website, tracker, documentation, etc.)</li>\n<li>Maintaining related projects (plugins, etc.)</li>\n<li>Creating visual designs</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Core team membership acknowledges sustained and valuable efforts that align well with the philosophy and the goals of the Manim project.</p>\n<p>It is usually granted when an informal private poll on Discord gains consensus.</p>\n<p>Core team members are always looking for promising contributors, teaching them how the project is managed, and submitting their names to the core team's vote when they're ready.</p>\n<p>There's no time limit on core team membership.\r\nHowever, in order to provide the general public with a reasonable idea of how many people maintain Manim, core team members who have stopped contributing are encouraged to declare themselves as \"inactive\".\r\nThose who haven't made any non-trivial contribution in two years may be asked to move themselves to this category, and moved there if they don't respond.\r\nTo record and honor their contributions, inactive team members will continue to be listed alongside active core team members; and, if they later resume contributing, they can switch back to active status at will.\r\nWhile someone is in inactive status, though, they lose their active privileges like voting or nominating for the steering council, and commit access.</p>\n<p>The initial active core team members will consist of everyone currently listed in the \"Manim core\" team on Github, and the initial inactive members will consist of everyone else who has been a committer in the past.</p>\n<h2 id=\"changing-this-document\" style=\"position:relative;\">Changing this document<a href=\"#changing-this-document\" aria-label=\"changing this
